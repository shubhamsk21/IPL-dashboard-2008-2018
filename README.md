# IPL-dashboard-2008-2018
I'm excited to delve into the Excel dashboard project I'm currently crafting for educational purposes. This endeavor, titled "IPL 2008-2018 Analysis," serves as a concrete application of the knowledge and skills I've acquired throughout my studies. It provides a practical, hands-on experience in both data analysis and spreadsheet management, focusing on the Indian Premier League seasons from 2008 to 2018.
Ah, got it. Let's tailor the description accordingly:

The project, named "IPL Insights Dashboard," aims to provide stakeholders with a comprehensive view of Indian Premier League (IPL) statistics from 2008 to 2018. It will include data on total matches played, win percentages of teams, overall tournament performance, team-wise performance metrics, player statistics such as runs scored, wickets taken, and batting averages, monthly trends in match outcomes, comparisons between current and previous years' performances, stadium-wise analysis, surface conditions impact on match results, and insights into match outcomes based on day/night fixtures.
Certainly! Based on your primary Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), your IPL Insights Dashboard will include:

1. **Matches Won by Team based on Toss Decision**: A visual representation of matches won by teams when batting first or bowling first after winning the toss. This could be depicted through a bar chart or pie chart to show the distribution of wins based on toss decision.

2. **Toss Decision Impact on Winning**: A comparative analysis showing the percentage of matches won by teams choosing to bat first or bowl first after winning the toss. This could be presented as a stacked bar chart or a line graph to visualize the trend over the years.

3. **Maximum Playing Stadium**: A visualization displaying the stadium where the maximum number of matches have been played during the IPL seasons from 2008 to 2018. This could be represented using a map or a bar chart showing the frequency of matches played at each stadium.

4. **Title Winner and Man of the Match**: A section highlighting the IPL champions for each year and the players who won the "Man of the Match" award in the final matches. This information can be presented in a tabular format or with images of the winning teams and players.

These KPIs will provide valuable insights into the performance trends of IPL teams, the impact of toss decisions on match outcomes, the popularity of stadiums, and the key players and teams that have been successful in winning titles and earning individual accolades throughout the IPL seasons.


All answers to the provided questions are accessible within the dashboard.
